This is the CrystallApp project repository
27.Oct.2024

This is the django framework for an application that helps to construct
molecular models of surfaces and nanoparticles of various sizes and
morphologies. From user input, a list of atomic types and coordinates
(also cell size/shape information, if necesary) is generated for download
in XYZ and POSCAR format text-files.

This project is still in its first stages and some parameter combinations
may not work. These bugs are being fixed and new functions are expected to
be added in the future. Thanks for lurking.
